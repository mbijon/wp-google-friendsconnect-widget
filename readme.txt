Google Friendsconnect OpenID & Faces widget.

== Description ==

This widget allows you to display a little (200px) widget in the sidebar which allows you to display the Google FC members of your site.

This widget was intended for use with [Google Friend Connect Integration](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-friend-connect-integration/), but it can be used independant as well. 
However; for full friend Connect integration, I'd suggest you install it anyway.

I'm still developing this widget, so more options will be added in the near future.

Minimum requirements are:

* Wordpress **2.8** or more recent.
* A sidebar that is **AT LEAST** 200px wide.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the widget and get it working.

1. Upload the map contained in this .zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the widget through the 'Appearance -> Widgets' menu in WordPress.
1. Lookuop your Google Friendsconnect ID, and paste it in the Widget options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this a plugin? =

No, this is **NOT** a plugin, it contains only a widget.

Here: [Google Friend Connect](http://www.google.com/friendconnect) look at the page underneath the "Site Settings" link on the right hand side of the page. You must, however, have at least one site setup, or setup a new site.
